# Place Finder using Google Maps
## Overview
This is a template React-Redux project that uses the Ant Design UI library and the google-map-react library to integrate Google Maps into the application. The application also utilizes Axios to make Google Maps Place Autocomplete and Details API calls. As a development project, CORS policy had to be unblocked to use the Google Maps API, and this was done through the use of a Chrome extension named CORS Unblock.
